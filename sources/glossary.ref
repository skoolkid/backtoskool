 character.

[Glossary:Command list]
#R59392(List of commands) used to control a character during a lesson.

[Glossary:Continual subcommand]
One of various character-controlling command routines whose address is stored
in bytes #b23 and #b24 of a character's buffer. The command is executed each
time the character is moved - before the interruptible subcommand or primary
command - unless the character is under the control of an uninterruptible
subcommand (see #R25296).

[Glossary:Interruptible subcommand]
One of various character-controlling command routines whose address is stored
in bytes #b9 and #b10 of a character's buffer. If present, the command is
executed each time the character is moved, unless the character is under the
control of an uninterruptible subcommand (see #R25296).

[Glossary:Midstride]
Of a character: in phase 2 or 4 of the walking animation. For example:

#UDGTABLE
{ #CALL(as_img(129)) | #CALL(as_img(131)) }
TABLE#

[Glossary:Primary command]
One of various character-controlling command routines whose address is stored
in bytes #b3 and #b4 of a character's buffer. If present, the command is
executed each time the character is moved, unless the character is under the
control of an uninterruptible or interruptible subcommand (see #R25296).

[Glossary:SRB]
Screen refresh buffer at #R32512.

[Glossary:Uninterruptible subcommand]
One of various character-controlling command routines whose address is stored
in bytes #b17 and #b18 of a character's buffer. If present, the command is
executed each time the character is moved, and overrides any other command (see
#R25296).
