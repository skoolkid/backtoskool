<div class="box-title">The importance of little boy no. 10</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In demo mode, ERIC bases his every move on where little boy no. 10 is and what
he's doing (see the routine at <a href="../asm/62483.html">62483</a>). One corollary of this important role
is that little boy no. 10 is in all of ERIC's classes (if he weren't, ERIC
would be guilty of truancy in demo mode). In fact, little boy no. 10 is the
only character besides EINSTEIN who joins ERIC for every class.

<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">BASIC saver POKEs</div>
<div class="paragraph">
There are two POKEs in line 33 of the <a href="../save/33013.html">BASIC saver program</a> that
saves the fast code block to tape:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE 29387,80: POKE 29391,45
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
These POKEs set the instruction at <a href="../asm/29118.html#29130">29130</a> to 'LD L,80' and the
instruction at <a href="../asm/29118.html#29135">29135</a> to 'DEC L'. (The contents of addresses
24832-32767 are shifted down by 256 bytes to 24576 by the startup routine
at <a href="../start/33204.html">33204</a> before the game starts.) Which makes one wonder what these
instructions were before they were POKEd.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
As it turns out, some tapes of Back to Skool were released that are missing
line 33 in the BASIC saver program, and contain 79 at address 29387
(29131) and 44 at address 29391 (29135); with these values, the
corresponding section of code looks like this:

<div class="paragraph">
This code makes ERIC move left when the Kempston joystick is moved right, and
vice versa. Which is clearly a bug, and indicates that line 33 of the BASIC
saver program is nothing more nor less than a bugfix.

<div><span id="assemblyWait"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">MR WACKER waits for ERIC</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Like time, MR WACKER waits for no man - except when it's assembly and the man
(or boy) is ERIC. In fact, MR WACKER will dutifully wait on stage, silent and
motionless, until ERIC has arrived in the vicinity of the assembly hall, before
delivering his detention speech.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To verify this curious phenomenon, proceed as follows. When the bell rings for
assembly, go to the right end of the dinner hall and stand so that the stairs
leading down to the stage are just visible at the far right of the screen. Now
keep an eye on MR WACKER; when he decides that it's time to start assembly and
begins his descent down those stairs, move left until the screen has scrolled
twice and the stage is no longer in view. Then wait a bit - long enough for MR
WACKER to have reached the stage and begun his speech. After that, move right
until the screen scrolls once and brings MR WACKER back into view. MR WACKER
will be standing on the stage, and only when the screen stops scrolling will he
begin his detention speech.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(Hanging around on the outskirts of the assembly hall during assembly is a fine
way to get lines, so you might want to use the <a href="pokes.html#noLines">no lines POKE</a>
before trying this for yourself.)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this uncharacteristically patient behaviour is the routine at
<a href="../asm/62032.html">62032</a>, which makes MR WACKER stand on the stage doing nothing until he comes
into view (or the bell rings for the next lesson, whichever happens first).

ERIC can usually throw a punch or fire his catapult and be confident that the
impact will send one of the kids or teachers tumbling. However, on certain
occasions, certain characters are invulnerable to ERIC's violence. Those
characters and occasions are as follows:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

There are 64 periods in the <a href="../asm/46528.html">main timetable</a>: 16 playtimes, 8
assemblies, 2 dinner periods, and 38 lesson periods (when ERIC is supposed to
be in either a classroom or the Revision Library).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the 38 lesson periods, ERIC is scheduled to be in the Science Lab 15 times,
the Blue Room 7 times, the Yellow Room 7 times, and the Revision Library 9
times.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ERIC has 11 classes with MR ROCKITT, 10 classes with MR CREAK, and 8 classes
with MR WITHIT.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ERIC has 11 classes with MR ROCKITT in the Science Lab (which is more than any
other teacher/classroom combination), but only one class with MR WITHIT in the
Yellow Room.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR WACKER is on dinner duty for one of the dinner periods, and MR WITHIT is on
duty for the other one.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR CREAK is the busiest teacher: he teaches a class in 37 of the 38 lesson
periods (lesson <a href="../lessons/42.html">42</a> being the only time he takes a break). MR WITHIT is
the laziest teacher, teaching a class in only 29 periods.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR ROCKITT teaches most often in the Science Lab (28 times), MR CREAK teaches
most often in the Yellow Room (23 times), and MR WITHIT teaches most often in
the Blue Room (18 times).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR WACKER spends 21 of the lesson periods (including 4 of the 9 Revision
Library periods) pacing up and down in his study, and the remaining 17 lesson
periods on a tour of the boys' skool, oscillating between the cloak room, the
assembly hall stage, and his study.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Every boy is taught at least 4 times by each teacher, and at least 4 times in
each classroom. In addition, every boy has at least one lesson period in the
Revision Library, though little boy no. 9 has only one period there (lesson
<a href="../lessons/42.html">42</a>), while all the others have at least three.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ANGELFACE spends more lesson periods in the Revision Library than any other boy
(14 periods compared to ERIC's 9).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the 38 lesson periods, MISS TAKE teaches 24 times in the top-floor classroom
and 14 times in the middle-floor classroom.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
HAYLEY has only one lesson period in a classroom with no teacher (lesson
<a href="../lessons/42.html">42</a> in the top-floor classroom); each of the other little girls has at
least three such lesson periods.

location</a> to another; little boys 1-3, however, each spend two of these
playtimes walking up and down in the Revision Library until the bell rings.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Like little boys 4-10, all the little girls spend every playtime on a random
walkabout; HAYLEY, however, spends 12 playtimes on random walkabouts, and 4
playtimes walking up and down in the kitchen in the girls' skool until the bell
rings.

MISS TAKE spends 9 playtimes walking up and down in the kitchen in the girls'
skool, and the remaining 7 on random walkabouts.

However, there is evidence that they were used at one time and were later
discarded. The evidence lies in columns 88-92 of the play area, which contain
tiles mostly from the tail end of base page 136 and the beginning of base
page 144. The usage of tiles from base page 144 in each column is as follows:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

Note the gaps where tiles 1, 11, 21 and 30 seem to be missing from
columns 88-91, and tile 40 is present instead. Furthermore, tile 40 is used
at the same y-coordinate (14) in each of those columns. So what would the
relevant region of the play area - on the middle floor next to the window at
the right end of the boys' skool - look like if tiles 1, 11, 21 and 30
were used instead of tile 40? Here are the 'before' and 'after' pictures:

To my eye, the 'after' picture looks nicer: the bottoms of the boxes (or
whatever those objects are) no longer look as if they've been chopped off.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
So why were tiles 1, 11, 21 and 30 left unused? Probably because when
they <em>are</em> used, the bottoms of the boxes appear under the feet of any
characters walking past, which looks a bit wrong:

Depending on which part of the play area is currently on-screen, the
character-moving routine at <a href="../asm/25296.html">25296</a> will skip certain minor characters, thus
giving a performance boost to the other characters. Don't let the fact that
there are immobilised kids off-screen to the left or right distract ERIC from

scrolling the screen left (as ERIC leaves the boys' skool or approaches the
girls' skool), the routine at <a href="../asm/25026.html">25026</a> considers teleporting little boys
1-8. And just before the bell rings for a new lesson, the routine at <a href="../asm/63309.html">63309</a>

then appears at its initial location in the storeroom (see <a href="../asm/31254.html#31372">31372</a>).

You may have noticed that the frog is a tricky fellow to catch, and the reason
is that it's programmed to be wary of ERIC. If ERIC is not close to the frog,
it will decide to keep still three times out of four. But as soon as ERIC gets
close, the frog will make a move (turn round or take a hop). See <a href="../asm/30906.html">30906</a>.

Unlike the theme tune and the tune that plays when ERIC opens the safe, the
other sound effects in the game are played with interrupts enabled, which means
they are affected by keys being held down. This is especially noticeable with
the bell and the lines-giving sounds, which are somewhat longer than the
others. To make them even longer:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>POKE <a href="../asm/32433.html#32489">32489</a>,80 (bell)</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Now put ERIC up to mischief in front of a teacher, or wait for the bell to
ring, and see if you can detect the change in pitch as you hold down various
keys.

When ALBERT tells MR WACKER that ERIC is escaping, MR WACKER comes hurrying to
the scene. However, if ERIC stands one step away from the skool door, MR WACKER
will stand on the other side without opening it, continually giving ERIC lines
for not being in class while at the same time preventing him from getting
there.

<div class="paragraph">
During some playtimes, ANGELFACE specifically hunts down HAYLEY for the sole
purpose of hitting her (see command list <a href="../asm/58844.html">44</a>). Which is bad, because
ERIC's chances of scoring a kiss diminish every time HAYLEY hits the floor (see

Every time HAYLEY is knocked down (by ANGELFACE's or ERIC's fist, or by BOY

decreased by one (see the section of code at <a href="../asm/30102.html#30155">30155</a>), thus making her less

Recall Skool Daze, where you could sit on the stairs and be given lines for
it. Seems so long ago, eh? Well, even though you can't sit on the stairs in
Back to Skool (or be given lines for it), you may find consolation in evidence
that suggests it was possible at some point while the game was being developed:
the lost lines message at <a href="../asm/60480.html">60480</a>. Unused, but never purged. Feel any better

<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Aggressive unseating</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If ERIC is pushed out of a seat in a classroom in the girls' skool, he lies
flat on his back as if knocked out by a punch or a catapult pellet, instead of
just sitting on the floor (as he would if he were pushed out of a seat in the
boys' skool).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Now, this fact is impossible to verify in an unmodified game because ERIC is
incapable of being pushed out of his seat to begin with. But even if he were,
it's still difficult to verify because the girls won't sit down until MISS TAKE
arrives at the classroom doorway and tells them to, and she won't do that until
the boys' skool door is closed. On top of that, if she spots ERIC, she'll chase
him down instead of conducting the class. So to fix all of these problems:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div><span id="pelletVsLid"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">ERIC's pellet v. water v. plant v. desk lid</div>
<div class="paragraph">
RAM is in short supply in Back to Skool. For example, ERIC's catapult pellet is
forced to share its character buffer with plants, desk lids, and water/sherry
fired from the pistol. One consequence of this is that ERIC cannot open a desk
lid immediately after firing his catapult. Another is that ERIC cannot fire his
catapult immediately after firing his water pistol, or while waiting for a
watered plant to grow. Yet another is that he cannot fire his water pistol
while his catapult pellet is still airborne.

<div><span id="pelletVsStinkbomb"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">BOY WANDER's pellet v. stinkbomb</div>
<div class="paragraph">
As already mentioned, RAM is in short supply in Back to Skool. So much so that
BOY WANDER's pellet is forced to share its character buffer with the stinkbomb
cloud. However, unlike ERIC's pellet, which is allowed to complete its flight
before giving up its buffer to some other object, BOY WANDER's pellet can be
terminated immediately by dropping a stinkbomb. Try it and see: find the
stinkbombs, then hang around BOY WANDER. When he lets rip with the catapult,
drop a stinkbomb and watch the pellet die young. See <a href="../asm/57910.html">57910</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="allAboutMice"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">All about mice</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Did I mention that RAM is in short supply in Back to Skool? So much so that
when ERIC releases a mouse, instead of using a character buffer of its own, it
hijacks the character buffer of one of the boys: little boy no. 9, little boy
no. 10, BOY WANDER, ANGELFACE or EINSTEIN. See <a href="../asm/31502.html">31502</a>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The hijacking will only happen if the boy is far enough away from the girls'
skool at the time of release, though, which is safe because mice can only be
released in the girls' skool. See <a href="../asm/31462.html">31462</a>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
How do the boys get their buffers back? Unlike the 'main' mouse in the game -
which shares its buffer with the frog, again owing to RAM limitations - mice
released by ERIC eventually die (either from old age, or by ERIC leaving the
vicinity of the girls' skool). When a released mouse expires, the character
whose buffer it hijacked will rematerialise at x-coordinate 32 on whichever
floor the mouse was on when it passed away. That is deep enough into the boys
skool that you will never notice it happening. No matter how fast you run from
the girls' skool after releasing a bunch of mice, they'll all be dead before
you reach the far left end of the boys' skool. See <a href="../asm/31254.html">31254</a>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Don't bother trying to catch any of the mice released by ERIC: they cannot be
re-caught. Only the 'main' mouse (using buffer 212) can ever be caught. See
<a href="../asm/31573.html">31573</a>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The aforementioned 'main' mouse always begins life in a new game at coordinates
(17,3) in the Blue Room (see <a href="../asm/54272.html#54305">54305</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
One more thing: when ERIC catches a mouse, a new one is supposed to materialise
somewhere else off-screen. However, because of a <a href="bugs.html#rematerialisingMouse">bug</a>
in the mouse placement code, the new mouse can sometimes be spotted appearing
on-screen out of thin air at x-coordinate 10, 88 or 170.

<div class="box-title">The conker and the clock</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Ever stood at the top-floor window of the boys' skool (as ERIC, naturally),
getting more and more frustrated because time is running out for you to knock
ALBERT out with a conker and get the sherry before the bell rings? Then you may
find some relief in the knowledge that you will have plenty of time to visit
the girls' skool and fill up the pistol with the contents of MISS TAKE's wine
stash, no matter how long it took you to give ALBERT a concussion. Why? Because
when you do manage to land the fateful nut on ALBERT's bonce, the skool clock
is magically wound back, thus delaying the onset of the next lesson. See the
section of code at <a href="../asm/30102.html#30145">30145</a>.

When assembly finishes (that is, when MR WACKER has finished speaking), the
skool clock's MSB is set to 1, which means the bell will ring soon after, no
matter how early MR WACKER arrived at the stage to deliver his detention
speech. See <a href="../asm/62032.html">62032</a>.

<div><span id="inferiorCatapult"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Inferior catapult</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The catapult in Back to Skool is not quite so handy as the one in Skool
Daze. In both games, the catapult's range is the same (13 spaces), but in Back
to Skool, its 'hit zone' is shorter (the last 4 spaces of the range instead of
the last 7). So in Back to Skool, ERIC has to be further away from his target
in order to hit it.
