<div class="paragraph">
When ERIC fires his catapult, he should go through the following sequence of
animation phases:
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
When ERIC kisses HAYLEY, he moves one space forward (see <a href="../asm/5F1C.html">5F1C</a>). This allows
ERIC to pass through the skool gate if he kisses HAYLEY from behind it while
it's shut.

<div class="box-title">Wrong plant pot</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If ERIC is standing on a plant pot when a fully grown plant in another pot
dies, he will fall to the ground. This is because the routine at <a href="../asm/FA4D.html">FA4D</a> checks
whether ERIC is standing on a plant pot when a plant dies, but doesn't check
whether it's the plant pot that contains the plant.

<div class="box-title">Rematerialising mouse</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The section of code at <a href="../asm/7B55.html#7b77">7B77</a> is responsible for bringing a new free mouse
into the game when ERIC has just caught one. The apparent intention is that the
new free mouse will begin life at an x-coordinate (chosen from 10, 88 and 170)
that is currently off-screen, so that you won't notice it appearing out of thin
air. However, the code is careless with the <span class="register">HL</span> register pair, with the
result that it is possible for a new free mouse to show up at any of these
x-coordinates, regardless of which portion of the play area is currently
on-screen.

<div class="box-title">Beyond the call of assembly duty</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR WITHIT takes assembly duty far too seriously. That he goes looking for ERIC
if said boy is absent from the assembly hall we can understand (even if we
don't approve). But if assembly has finished, it seems only fair that MR WITHIT
should end the chase and leave ERIC alone. No such luck, though.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To witness MR WITHIT's somewhat sickening sense of duty in this regard, proceed
as follows. Show up for assembly, sit down, and wait until MR WACKER arrives on
stage. When MR WACKER starts speaking, stand up and head for the skool door (to
the right). MR WITHIT will begin the chase, as expected. However, instead of
giving up when MR WACKER has finished speaking, MR WITHIT will continue to
hover around ERIC until the bell rings. (MR WITHIT does at least stop giving
ERIC lines at regular intervals after MR WACKER has finished speaking,
though. But that just makes the hovering feel rather creepy.)
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="assemblySit"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Assembly sitting confusion</div>
<div class="paragraph">
During assembly, if ERIC is standing a teacher will scream 'SIT FACING THE
STAGE', but if he's sitting down facing left (away from the stage), a teacher
will scream 'NOW SIT DOWN'. This is the wrong way round.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div><span id="assemblySit2"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">More assembly sitting confusion</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Usually, the kids will sit down for assembly soon after the MSB of the lesson
clock reaches 10 (see <a href="../asm/F0DA.html">F0DA</a>), in good time for MR WACKER's arrival on stage -
which he doesn't bother to head off for until the MSB of the lesson clock
reaches 8 (see <a href="../asm/F80D.html">F80D</a>). However, careful examination of the routine at <a href="../asm/F0DA.html">F0DA</a>
reveals that not only must the MSB of the lesson clock have reached 10, but MR
WITHIT must have arrived in the assembly hall too, otherwise the kids will not
sit down. In fact, they will continue to walk around aimlessly in the assembly
hall while MR WACKER is delivering his detention speech. And if MR WITHIT
arrives late enough, the kids will carry on walking around aimlessly in the
assembly hall even after MR WACKER has left the stage (instead of heading off
to some random location, as they would normally do).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To witness the kids' confusion about when to sit, try making MR WITHIT late for
assembly by knocking him over with a catapult pellet four or five times before
he reaches the assembly hall. Then go and stand just behind MR ROCKITT and MR
CREAK - who should have reached the assembly hall by now - with the stage in
view at the far right of the screen. With luck, you'll be able to keep MR
WITHIT out of the assembly hall with a few more well-aimed catapult pellets
while watching (a) the kids wander around aimlessly instead of sitting down,
and (b) MR WACKER deliver his detention speech and then leave, apparently
unfazed by the lack of attention.

<div><span id="albertBusy"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Keeping ALBERT busy</div>
<div class="paragraph">
After closing the skool door, ALBERT paces up and down underneath the tree
while keeping an eye out for ERIC. If ERIC jumps out of the window and makes a
beeline for the girls' skool, ALBERT will raise his arm, thus blocking the path
to MISS TAKE's sherry. Now this behaviour makes sense during lessons, but not
during playtime. However, if ERIC stands his ground after being caught by
ALBERT, the caretaker will never budge. Even after the lesson ends and the bell
rings for playtime. Which means it will be up to one of the teachers to open
the skool door (if MR WACKER hasn't done so already after being alerted) and
the skool gate.
</div>

After closing the skool door, ALBERT paces up and down underneath the tree

beeline for the girls' skool, ALBERT will raise the alarm, whereupon MR WACKER
will come rushing to ERIC's side to make sure the truant gets back to skool and
stays there. Now this behaviour makes sense during lessons, but not during
playtime. However, if ERIC jumps out of the window during a lesson, stands
patiently up against the skool door so as not to catch ALBERT's attention, and
then rushes towards him just after the bell rings for playtime, ALBERT will
raise his arm and the alarm. Which means MR WACKER will come looking for ERIC
and shadow him until playtime is over.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Waiting for EINSTEIN</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Before wiping the board and getting a lesson under way, ERIC's teacher will
wait for EINSTEIN to sit down first: see <a href="../asm/F048.html">F048</a>. This makes sense at the
beginning of a lesson, but that same routine is called several times during the
course of a lesson (see <a href="../asm/F100.html">F100</a>) to check whether ERIC is present, which means
that the teacher will also stop whatever he's doing and wait for EINSTEIN to
sit down before continuing on those occasions too. This is not really
noticeable except during lessons where there is no question-and-answer
session taking place between the teacher and the swot, and the teacher is
pacing up and down in front of the blackboard instead. During those lessons,
the call to <a href="../asm/F048.html">F048</a> is made each time the teacher has reached the point where
he is just about to turn round; if EINSTEIN is not sitting in a chair at that
time (because ERIC has pushed him out of his seat, for example), the teacher
will wait until EINSTEIN is back in his seat before turning round.

<div class="paragraph">
This phenomenon can be made more readily reproducible and observable by using
the following POKEs:

At the very least, these desk lid animatory states should be used the other way

to fix this, we need to swap the tile references for the desk lid animatory
states themselves:

<div class="box-title">Talking garbage</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If one character is speaking while a second is waiting to speak, and the screen
scrolls so that the speaking character is shifted out of view, the second
character may start talking garbage. What happens is that the character who was
speaking first is tricked into thinking that his speech bubble is still
on-screen, and the two characters end up sharing the bubble opened by the
second character.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To see how the first character is tricked, consider the case where MR CREAK is
at the Blue Room door, telling the kids to sit down, and MR WITHIT is at the
Yellow Room door, waiting for MR CREAK to finish speaking:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>0) MR CREAK is under control of the entry point at <a href="../asm/6A08.html#6a2e">6A2E</a> (speaking); MR
WITHIT is under control of the entry point at <a href="../asm/6A08.html#6a1d">6A1D</a> (waiting to speak).</div>
<div>1) The screen scrolls left, taking MR CREAK and his speech bubble out of
view.</div>
<div>2) <a href="../asm/62A0.html">62A0</a> (update display) is called from the main loop; this calls
<a href="../asm/68E1.html">68E1</a>, which sets <a href="../asm/7FF8.html">7FF8</a> to 0 (indicating that the bubble is no longer
on-screen).</div>
<div>3) MR WITHIT begins execution of the entry point at <a href="../asm/6A08.html#6a1d">6A1D</a>; this detects
that <a href="../asm/7FF8.html">7FF8</a> is now 0, and so calls <a href="../asm/694E.html">694E</a> to open the speech bubble,
which:</div>
<div>&#160; a) sets <a href="../asm/7FF8.html">7FF8</a> to some non-zero value (indicating that the bubble
is on-screen), and</div>
<div>&#160; b) updates <a href="../asm/7FFA.html">7FFA</a> to the current leftmost column on-screen.</div>
<div>4) MR CREAK begins execution of the entry point at <a href="../asm/6A08.html#6a2e">6A2E</a>; this first
calls <a href="../asm/68E1.html">68E1</a>, which:</div>
<div>&#160; a) detects the non-zero value in <a href="../asm/7FF8.html">7FF8</a>, and</div>
<div>&#160; b) fails to detect that the screen has scrolled, because MR WITHIT
updated <a href="../asm/7FFA.html">7FFA</a>,</div>
<div>thus fooling MR CREAK into thinking that his speech bubble is still
on-screen.</div>
<div>5) MR CREAK and MR WITHIT share the speech bubble, taking turns rolling

If ERIC stands against the far wall of the Science Lab storeroom while facing
it, and then fires his catapult, the pellet will travel through the wall. See
the routine at <a href="../asm/6E9B.html">6E9B</a> (which lets ERIC reach x-coordinate 63 - rather too
close to that far wall), and the routine at <a href="../asm/7654.html">7654</a> (which takes that far wall

If ERIC stands against the right study door while facing it, and then fires his

which checks for the presence of the right study door at x-coordinate 84 in
front of the pellet. But when ERIC is standing up against the door, he is
already at x-coordinate 84, which is where the pellet will be launched from; so
at launch time, the x-coordinate of the spot in front of the pellet is 83, and
the door check fails.

<div class="box-title">Conker of mass destruction</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The section of code at <a href="../asm/74C8.html#74f7">74F7</a> was probably meant to check whether any of the
four main kids besides ERIC has been hit by the falling conker. However,
because the <span class="register">B</span> and <span class="register">D</span> registers are not properly initialised before
calling the routine at <a href="../asm/6CAC.html">6CAC</a>, every character (including the non-human
objects) is treated as a potential target.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
One consequence of this bug is that it's possible to knock out the little boys
with the conker. Not all that interesting, I suppose.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Another consequence of this bug is that it's possible to 'knock out' the bike.
But, of course, there is no 'knocked out bike' sprite; instead, an airborne
frog (specifically, animatory state <a href="../graphics/as.html#30">0x1E</a> or <a href="../graphics/as.html#158">0x9E</a>, depending on which way the
bike is facing) is displayed. Which is rather more interesting. (And easy to
verify, too, since the bike is not a moving target. Just park it at the base of
the tree and get firing through the top-floor window.)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Unfortunately, owing to a technicality, the other non-human objects - mouse,
frog, BOY WANDER's pellet etc. - are not vulnerable to the conker's destructive
effects. (That technicality being that each is controlled by a routine whose
address is stored in bytes 0x11 and 0x12 of the character buffer, so they are
passed over by the routine at <a href="../asm/6CAC.html">6CAC</a>.) Oh well.

<div><span id="noBlackboardTales"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">No blackboard tales</div>
<div class="paragraph">
EINSTEIN never tells tales on ERIC or BOY WANDER for writing on the
blackboard. This is because the section of code at <a href="../asm/F100.html#f19c">F19C</a> calls <a href="../asm/6755.html">6755</a> to
collect the ID of the blackboard that the teacher is standing beside, but that
routine returns early (with an invalid blackboard ID in <span class="register">B</span>) because the
teacher is not standing within a threshold of 4 spaces of the left edge of the
board. Instead, the routine at <a href="../asm/6FF2.html">6FF2</a> should be called, which collects the ID
of the blackboard within a threshold of 12 spaces:

But this reveals another bug in the section of code at <a href="../asm/F100.html#f19c">F19C</a>: instead of
placing the message number for the name of the character EINSTEIN is grassing
up (<a href="../asm/EFA1.html">0x1B</a> or <a href="../asm/EFD5.html">0x1F</a>) into <a href="../asm/7F90.html">7F90</a>, it places the character
number (0xCE or 0xD2) there, which means EINSTEIN ends up saying either:

'Please Sir I cannot tell a lie . . 714 wrote on the board'
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
('714' being message <a href="../asm/FD74.html">0xCE</a>) or:

<div class="box-title">Double wipe</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If ERIC leaves class at some point after the teacher has started wiping the
board, but returns while EINSTEIN is telling the teacher that he's absent, the
teacher will give ERIC or EINSTEIN lines, and then start wiping the board again
(see <a href="../asm/F100.html#f1cb">F1CB</a>), without first walking to the right edge of the board. This means
that either:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>(a) the lesson will resume with the teacher standing near the doorway (if
the class is in the Yellow Room or the Science Lab), or</div>
<div>(b) the teacher will walk through the far left wall of the boys' skool,
conduct the rest of the lesson from behind the wall until the bell rings, and
later reappear through the far right wall of the girls' skool (if the class is
in the Blue Room).</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
You can confirm (b) by making use of the <a href="bugs.html#farLeft">far left scroll bug</a> to
scroll the screen left until the girls' skool is in view. Or you can follow the
teacher through the 'no man's land' between the two skools by using the POKEs

This happens because the board-wiping routine (<a href="../asm/680F.html">680F</a>) calls <a href="../asm/6FF2.html">6FF2</a> to
collect information about the blackboard, which in turn calls <a href="../asm/6755.html">6755</a>. That
routine returns early (with bogus blackboard coordinates in <span class="register">DE</span>) because the
teacher is not standing at a blackboard, but <a href="../asm/680F.html">680F</a> carries on regardless, and
the teacher ends up wiping a non-existent blackboard at the non-existent
location (58,211), with the result that certain non-blackboard tiles end up
getting wiped instead.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This bug can be hard to reproduce because the bell usually rings before you get
a chance to make the teacher begin the third wipe; to improve your chances, try
the <a href="pokes.html#lessonLength">lesson length POKEs</a> to extend the lesson.

<div><span id="665360Lines"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">YOU HAVE 665360 LINES ERIC</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If ERIC has 10000 lines or more, but manages to jump up to the safe (while
holding the key) before MR WACKER comes to expel him, he will move on to the
next year; what's more, ERIC will not risk expulsion again until the lines
total has rolled over the maximum 655300 mark back round to zero, and then past
10000 again.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is that the routine at <a href="../asm/73CB.html">73CB</a> sends MR WACKER on his way
to expel ERIC only when the lines total reaches or exceeds 10000 for the first
time, and moving on to the next year makes MR WACKER completely forget his
expulsion duties.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="deceptiveDoorways"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Deceptive doorways</div>
<div class="paragraph">
It would be reasonable to assume that the doorway to a classroom in the boys'
skool marks the boundary beyond which ERIC may be regarded as either absent
from or present in that class (depending on which side of the boundary he
stands). But it is not so.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
For example, the Blue Room extends beyond its doorway, such that ERIC is
regarded as present when he is standing anywhere up to and including
x-coordinate 23 (even though he appears to be entirely outside the classroom at
that location):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<table class="">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="deceptive_doorways1" src="../images/play_area/deceptive_doorways1.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
So ERIC can stand here during a class in the Blue Room without EINSTEIN telling
on him for being absent, or stand here during Revision Library and be told to
GET ALONG NOW.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Similarly, the Yellow Room extends beyond its right-hand doorway, all the way
up to and including x-coordinate 63:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<table class="">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="deceptive_doorways2" src="../images/play_area/deceptive_doorways2.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, the Yellow Room has its left boundary at x-coordinate 41, so if ERIC
stands at x-coordinate 40, he is regarded as absent (even though he appears to
be entirely inside the classroom):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<table class="">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="deceptive_doorways3" src="../images/play_area/deceptive_doorways3.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(Try standing here while waiting for the lesson in the Yellow Room to begin;
EINSTEIN will tell the teacher that ERIC is absent, and the teacher will go
looking for him.)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Likewise, the left boundary of the Science Lab is at x-coordinate 31, a little
to the right of its doorway. Which means that if ERIC stands at x-coordinate
30, he is regarded as absent (again, even though he appears to be entirely
inside the classroom):
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<table class="">
<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="deceptive_doorways4" src="../images/play_area/deceptive_doorways4.png" /></td>

<div class="paragraph">
To adjust the real boundaries of the classrooms so that they are more closely
aligned with the apparent boundaries, see the location identifier tables at
<a href="../asm/BA3C.html">BA3C</a> (top floor) and <a href="../asm/BB3C.html">BB3C</a> (middle floor).

</div>
<div><span id="speechQueue"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Speech queue hogs</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ERIC's teacher and EINSTEIN can hog the 'speech queue' for several rounds of a
question-and-answer session, making the other teachers wait a long time -
sometimes until after the bell has rung - before they can tell the kids to sit
down or what to do during the lesson.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason this can happen is that there actually is no speech queue. That is,
there is no mechanism for recording whose 'turn' it is to speak next.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Consider the case where ERIC is being taught by MR CREAK in the Yellow Room,
and MR ROCKITT is teaching in the Science Lab:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul>
<li>MR CREAK is asking a question</li>
<li>EINSTEIN is waiting for MR CREAK to finish speaking</li>
<li>MR ROCKITT is standing at the blackboard, waiting to tell the kids what to
do</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When MR CREAK finishes speaking, the character-moving routine at <a href="../asm/62D0.html">62D0</a>
considers moving the following characters (after MR CREAK) in this order:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul>
<li>MISS TAKE</li>
<li>ALBERT</li>
<li>BOY WANDER</li>
<li>ANGELFACE</li>
<li>EINSTEIN</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
A character will be moved if bit 7 of byte 0x1D of his buffer is set (which is
true for kids half the time on average, and true for teachers only when they're
running), or if byte 0x1E of his buffer (which is decremented on each pass
through the character-moving routine) holds an even number. If either of these
is true for EINSTEIN, he will get to speak next. When he's finished answering
MR CREAK's question, the character-moving routine considers moving the
following characters (after EINSTEIN) in this order:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul>
<li>HAYLEY</li>
<li>little girls</li>
<li>little boys</li>
<li>MR WACKER</li>
<li>MR WITHIT</li>
<li>MR ROCKITT</li>
<li>MR CREAK</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If, on MR ROCKITT's turn, byte 0x1E of his buffer holds an odd number, he will
not be moved, and will therefore not start speaking before MR CREAK. If, on MR
CREAK's turn, byte 0x1E of his buffer holds an even number, he will be moved
and therefore start speaking before MR ROCKITT's next turn.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Thus MR ROCKITT could spend quite a while waiting at the blackboard before
telling the kids what to do, all depending on the contents of byte 0x1E of his,
MR CREAK's and EINSTEIN's buffers (and also bit 7 of byte 0x1D of EINSTEIN's
buffer) on their turns to be moved.

This is a consequence of the zero flag being set upon entry to the routine at

Play truant during class, somewhere on the top or middle floor. (The toilets
are an ideal spot.) As ERIC's teacher approaches, start jumping continuously
(hold 'J' down). When the teacher reaches the spot four spaces away from ERIC,
you might see him turn round briefly, and then turn round again to continue the
approach towards ERIC. The reason the teacher turns round is that he is tricked
into thinking that ERIC is on the bottom floor, and so starts heading for the
nearest staircase.

<div class="paragraph">
This is one more (less dramatic) consequence of the zero flag being set upon
